# Note to Code Shelter maintainers

I started this project a while ago and it grow and grow in popularity. Over the 
past few years I've hed less and less time to work on it, and that's unfair to 
all the people who use. I'd appreciate some help with maintaining the project. 
I will generally be available to consult and maybe develop the occasional
feature or bugfix, but my availability is not reliable.

It would be great if you could help out with issue triage, fixing bugs, 
merging pull request, improving documentation and test coverage and
occasionally developing new features that you think are necessary. The project
is mainly feature-complete and the Amazon API is quite stable, so I don't 
expect any major deviation and would appreciate being consulted before making 
any drastic changes, but other than that, you have free reign.

I have already added Code Shelter to the project's PyPI page, so feel free to
make any releases necessary. 

The codebase is in reasonable shape. The one major issue which needs sorting out
is that Amazon have terminated my associate account due to inactivity, and won't
let me create a new one (apperently maintaining this library does not qualify as 
a reason). The implication is that I do not have credentials to test the library with. 
I am working on sorting this one out but any help is welcome.

Thank you!
